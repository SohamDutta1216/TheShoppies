## Goal

### Acceptance Criteria
-Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
-Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
-Updates to the search terms should update the result list
-Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
-If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
-Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
